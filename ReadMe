The Following IPython notebook is adapted from a workshop I gave on data wrangling with Pandas, it now contains the following four main sections:

Hampshire police data example:
- Reading in csv files into a Dataframe using Ipython magic
- How to drop multiple columns 
- The use of various Pandas methods such as .to_datetime, .value_counts etc  
- Dataframe masking by string specification 
- Examples of visualisation using matplotlib's object oriented interface

Converting Numpy data to LaTeX:
- The removal of Nans from Dataframes using .dropna
- Replacing Nans in Dataframes with column averages using .fillna
- Outputting tabular Latex code with Pandas using .to_latex method

Simple least squares regression with statsmodels:
- A simple example of linear regression with the statsmodels package
- Setting up and running the linear regression 
- Viewing the summary results and plotting the residuals 
- Adding in a squared term into the model and seeing how it effects the     summary values 

Multiple linear regression, dummy variables, prediciting with train/test split:
- Loading in sklearn toy dataset into a Pandas Dataframe 
- Add the column names no longer present in the data 
- Recovering a Gender column which has been transformed into a numeric variable, back into a string column 
- Apply dummy variables to the new string column and append them to the original Dataframe
- (Commented out) a quick example how to scale/transform data in a Dataframe
- Plot each each attribute in the data against the target to check for linearity, this time using matplotlibs functional interface 
- Place the linearly correlated attributes in a new numpy array 
- Place the target data in a numpy array 
- Split the data into a 80/20 training/test set 
- Apply a linear regression model with all the variables 
- Plot predicted against test values and observe the model score 
- Check the variables for collinearity, drop some variables
- Reapply a linear regression for our improved model and 
  plot the new models predicted against test values and observe the score
 
The following packages are used: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, pylab, sklearn, scipy, statsmodels, warnings
